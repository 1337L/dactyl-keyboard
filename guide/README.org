* Preparation and Cost
   Get all the parts / raw material
   - For the 3D printing there are two options:
     1. Filament, which is the basis for 3D printing. Luckily I could print at my work-place
        which reduced the cost from 210€ to 70€
     2. Buy the printout of adareth's model at shapeways for 210€ over here
        http://www.shapeways.com/designer/adereth/creations
   - Decide on the switches
     - If you are going to invest a whole lot of time and money for a custom keyboard instead of
       buying one for 10€ I'd recommend to use your favorite switch-type. To make a
       well-informed decision I bought a switch-tester for this from massdrop and decided on
       Cherry MX Whites. https://www.massdrop.com/buy/varmilo-switch-tester-with-anodized-case
     - I ordered 70 Cherry MX Whites from here:
       https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=847
   - Decide on the key caps
     - On the glamour-Shot you can see the 1976 keycap set, it used to be sold over here:
       http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-1976-keycap-set/ but the link is dead right now. You could
       try this link: https://www.massdrop.com/buy/nineteenseventysix-sa-keycap-set but it is a
       massdrop which is way different from usual online-stores. If you find a site that sells
       these make sure you get the right amount and type of keys according to the layout
     - I got the "TKL Base Set + TKL Modifier" from over here:
       http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-pbt-abs-blank-keycap-sets/ but I'm still too long keys
       short, I will have to order those specifically and I have a bunch of keys I don't use
       left-over.
   - The USB-Cable that connects the keyboard to your computer
     - It's an USB 2.0 to USB Mini-B cable, make sure you get one that is 2 meters long, it
       really makes handling the keyboard so much more comfortable
     - https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00NH11N5A/
   - The main controller (right half)
     - A Teensy 2.0, i got that one from here: https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html
   - The chip, connectors and cable to give life to the left half
     - TTRS cable and jacks
       - Got my TTRS cable from here: http://www.digikey.de/product-search/de?keywords=839-1257-ND
       - Got my TTRS jacks from here: http://www.digikey.de/product-search/de?keywords=CP-43514-ND
     - MCP23018 16 bitIO Expander
       - Got mine from here: http://www.digikey.de/product-search/de?keywords=MCP23018-E%2FSP-ND

   What I spend on my keyboard (should give you a rough estimate for your build):
   | item                              | cost |
   |-----------------------------------+------|
   | filament                          |   70 |
   | switch-tester                     |   30 |
   | key-caps                          |   70 |
   | teensy 2.0                        |   30 |
   | switches                          |   60 |
   | usb cable                         |   10 |
   | IO Expander, TTRS jacks and cable |   30 |
   |-----------------------------------+------|
   | overall cost                      |  300 |
   #+TBLFM: @9$2=vsum(@2$2..@8$2)

   My choices / advantages:
   - Using the soldering iron at the uni-workshop for free
   - 76 Diodes for free
   - Soldering wire and copper for free
   - All the resistors used for free (5 resistors are used)
   - Several files for working out the rough edges of the 3D-printout

   Depending on what you have available you might spend more or less money than me, 300€ however
   is a good rough estimate.

For now, take a look at the images and try to figure things out, I know
that's not great (it's better than nothing!)

** Making the PCB

Get two sheets of 6in square Pyralux™. Use the Toner Transfer method to
etch the Pyralux sheets as you would a usual PCB

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  NOTE: If you only have an Inkjet make photocopies of the print out,
  voilà Toner based copies!
#+END_QUOTE

[[http://www.instructables.com/id/Toner-transfer-no-soak-high-quality-double-sided/][Here'sa handy toner transfer guide ...]]

Print these PCB designs out...

Left hand:
[[left-hand-pcb-pyralux.png]]

Right hand:
[[right-hand-pcb-pyralux.png]]

When you're done etching, you'll need to carefully cut the pcb into
pieces... See the images below.

** This is Madness...

The thumb cluster pcb for the left hand:
[[madness.jpg]]

Solder the MCP like so:
[[left-hand-mcp-1.jpg]]
[[left-hand-mcp-2.jpg]]

Solder the Teensy 2.0 like so:
[[teensy-1.jpg]]

Some interesting pull up 10k resistor business here... (TODO add a small
diagram and notes)

[[teensy-2-fuxor-reziztorrs.jpg]]

Each hand of the keyboard will wire up like so:
[[right-hand-pcb-1.jpg]]

Teensy goes here... note the rows soldered to the teensy via the
Pyralux:
[[right-hand-pcb-with-teensy.jpg]]

Here the left hand:
[[hotglue-left-hand.jpg]]

That's all for now, this guide will improve over time! (TODO!)
